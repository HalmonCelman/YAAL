# YAAL - Yet Another Audio Library
it's basicly wrapper for OpenAL - to make things easier

some custom Classes and ideas to make things better and easier...

## How should I use it?
- now there aren't many things so you propably shouldn't ;)
- just install OpenAL as it's on their github
- join Sound.cpp and Sound.h to your project, you can see how I've done it in `CMakeLists.txt`
- Enjoy ;) ( more description in future )

## In future ( I believe near future )
- streaming audio
- creating listener
- setting position
- multiple sounds in diffrent places at once
